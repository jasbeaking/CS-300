## Project One: Runtime and Memory Analysis

In Project One, I performed an analysis of the run-time efficiency and memory usage related to different data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. The goal was to evaluate their performance in managing course information, especially regarding data retrieval and insertion.

- **Vector**: Although it is effective for simple storage, it shows slower performance during lookups, particularly in large datasets.
- **Hash Table**: This structure offers nearly constant-time access and is highly efficient for searches based on course ID.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: It supports ordered data management and enables efficient operations like lookup, insertion, and deletion, achieving an average complexity of O(log n).

By understanding these trade-offs, I was able to choose the most appropriate data structure depending on the need for quick access or data ordering.

## Project Two: Organized Course List

The second project focused on creating a menu-driven C++ application that:

- Imports course data from a CSV file.
- Structures it within a binary search tree.
- Displays all courses **in alphanumeric order** using in-order traversal.

This demonstrated expertise in recursive traversal methods and the use of binary search trees for sorting.

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The challenge was to develop a system that could effectively store, validate, and search for course information, using data structures that meet different performance needs.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I broke down each task into smaller, more manageable functionsâ€”loading data, validating prerequisites, and displaying information. I investigated the use of vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees to understand their pros and cons. Knowing which structure to use is essential for writing efficient code.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I encountered difficulties in reading CSV files, validating course prerequisites, and implementing recursive tree traversals. To address these challenges, I relied on systematic debugging techniques, revisited previous coursework for similar examples, and referred back to the course textbook for clarification on data structures and recursive algorithms. These resources helped me better understand the underlying concepts and work through the issues step by step.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has encouraged me to take a more analytical approach to data flow planning before starting to code. It has emphasized the significance of modular design and the need to choose the right tools and data structures for particular tasks.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I have improved my ability to write code that is clear, maintainable, and scalable. I now separate concerns more efficiently, use comments wisely, and develop functions that are more reusable.
